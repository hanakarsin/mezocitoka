He later found out that a decision was made at 2 a.m. to take his son and daughter to the Holiday Inn, but the airlines failed to notify him of their plan. He also pointed out that his kids were driven by a Frontier staff member in their personal vehicle.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>The worried dad also told CBS that he was only contacted about the delayed flight after midnight by his son. How? His son had to borrow a cellphone from another kid. "For Frontier to leave that messaging in the hands of seven and nine-year-olds, to me, is really unacceptable," Gray added.&nbsp;</p><p>When at the hotel, the "unaccompanied minors" were allegedly only given Rice Krispie treats and water. "[The flight] was really a disaster," he explained to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Orlando Sentinel</a>. "I think there needs to be set policies and procedures put in place [...] I think they probably escaped this incident with very little damage, but that may not be the case if it happens again."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Frontier Airlines' Response:</h2><p>In response to the Gray's public concern, a spokesperson for Frontier Airlines issued the following statement:</p>"We understand how an unexpected delay caused by weather can be stressful for a parent and our goal is to help passengers get to their destinations as quickly and safely as possible.&nbsp;We continued the flight the following morning, and in keeping with Frontier's policy, the children were attended to at all times by a Frontier supervisor, placed in a hotel room overnight, and provided with food.&nbsp;Our records show that the children were in contact with their mother before being transported to the hotel and with their father the following morning before leaving on the continued flight.&nbsp;We understand how an unexpected delay caused by weather can be stressful for a parent and our goal is to help passengers get to their destinations as quickly and safely as possible."<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>The father of two has denied that there was any communication between him and the airline, deeming this situation "just not acceptable." He told the Sentinel: "They should have been overly protective of these children."</p><p>According to Chad, the kids were eventually given a meal the next morning in the form of a McDonald's breakfast voucher they could use before boarding their flight. &nbsp;</p><p>Chad concluded:&nbsp;"They could have made sure the kids were comfortable and really reached out to make contact with the parents."&nbsp;</p><p>Parents were definitely divided over the issue on social media. For some, the airlines did more than enough by ensuring the safety of the kids during the unforeseen layover.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Others blamed the parents for not flying with their kids —&nbsp;or at least providing them with a cellphone.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Do you think airlines should reevaluate their policies for unaccompanied minors?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKaVrMBwfo9qb2hoaGR%2BdXuRoGmrqZRks7O7za2gnqpdqruir8KopKmZnp6ypXnMoqWoqg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffrontier-unaccompanied-minor.html&text=Unaccompanied%20Minors%20Spend%20Night%20in%20Hotel%20Room%20With%20Strangers%2c%20According%20to%20Dad&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrontier-unaccompanied-minor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrontier-unaccompanied-minor.html&title=Unaccompanied%20Minors%20Spend%20Night%20in%20Hotel%20Room%20With%20Strangers%2c%20According%20to%20Dad" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffrontier-unaccompanied-minor.html&title=Unaccompanied%20Minors%20Spend%20Night%20in%20Hotel%20Room%20With%20Strangers%2c%20According%20to%20Dad" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffrontier-unaccompanied-minor.html&title=Unaccompanied%20Minors%20Spend%20Night%20in%20Hotel%20Room%20With%20Strangers%2c%20According%20to%20Dad" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrontier-unaccompanied-minor.html&description=Unaccompanied%20Minors%20Spend%20Night%20in%20Hotel%20Room%20With%20Strangers%2c%20According%20to%20Dad" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./henry-thoreau-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Henry David Thoreau - Trivia, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./301541-poll-shows-65-kenyans-support-calls-referendum-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Poll shows 65% of Kenyans support calls for referendum">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
