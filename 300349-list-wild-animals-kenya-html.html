From the world renown Big Five and beautiful birds with dazzling colours to the Ugly Five and the Northern Five, this endless wildlife parade gives tourist eye-popping sightings every day. It would be true to note that these animals are too numerous to be mentioned one by one.

Kenya is fortunate to host all the animals in this category.</p><h3>African elephant</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0dbb5afd67fde647.jpeg><p class=align-left>This gigantic animal is a memorable sight and is among the most iconic species within the east African region. On average, an adult elephant weighs six tons and the majestic creature stands tall and strong up to feet.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b201157278fe83b2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 exotic animals you can legally own as pets in the US in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Notably, the massive mammal can be found in different areas of the country, but it is the famous Shimba Hills Reserve in particular that is well-known as home to the largest elephant population. They are important to the ecosystem in that as they bring down trees as they try to reach softer leaves at the top. This way, they create more space for savanna vegetation that grazers can enjoy. However, they are also known to wreak havoc in farms in different parts of the country.</p><p class=align-left>While they may be protected, the species' survival faces significant threat due to consistent poaching for tusks.</p><h3>Lion</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b201157278fe83b2.jpeg><p class=align-left>What is the national animal of Kenya? Ask any Kenyan this and they will tell you how symbolic the animal is. With his imposing roar and luxurious mane, the male lion is perceived as the king of the jungle. On average, an adult weighs up to <a href=# title="wild animals" rel="nofollow noopener">420 pounds</a>. The female counterpart, however, has a lesser mass.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ae6be87726796b1a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 most dangerous jungles in the world</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A pride of lions is usually symbolic of the continent’s wildlife, and as aforementioned, they are the most popular with safari travelers. As opposed to other carts that prefer solitary lifestyles, lions exhibit a different social behavior. A single male is tasked with ruling a group, and the females take part in hunting. They prey on large grazing animals such as zebras, gazelles, buffalo, or wildebeest.</p><p class=align-left>The best location to view lions is the Masai Mara National Reserve.</p><h3>Leopard</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/5f33f855a7f2abbe.jpeg><p class=align-left>This big cat is also part of the big five and it’s known for dragging prey onto the savanna scrub trees to avoid scavengers. For prey, this fantastic predator will consume whatever it can hunt and kill, and this includes much larger animals than those eaten by lions. Their population is relatively large in the country and they are not among the endangered species of the country.</p><p class=align-left>The all-black leopard variety (also known as the black panther) is also available and has been spotted in different areas in the country, Laikipia sighting being the most recent.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d54984355d001b58.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 25 most beautiful flags in the world today (with photos)</span></p></a><h2>Rhinoceros</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ae6be87726796b1a.jpeg><p class=align-left>Kenya is home to two species of the rhino; the white and black variables (even though both of them are gray in color). Across the world, the black rhino is one of the critically endangered species, and the number of white rhinos in the country is only a handful. Regardless, the white variety exists in higher numbers as you head further south of the continent.</p><p class=align-left>Even though they are among the most protected species, the magnificent herbivores are frequently hunted for their horns.</p><h3>Cape buffalo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/de224679d503a4df.jpeg><p class=align-left>This is the largest of the continent’s buffaloes and it weighs in at approximately half a ton. The massive creatures reside in numerous savanna landscapes in the country and feed on large grass quantities.</p><h2>The Northern 5</h2><p class=align-left>The iconic wild animals got the name due to the fact that they primarily reside in conservancies and national park towards the north of the capital, Nairobi, in a region of over 65,000 square kilometers. Here are some of the animals in this category.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/64fa855db0f7419c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 most beautiful countries in the world (with pictures) 2022</span></p></a><h3>Gerenuk/giraffe gazelle</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d54984355d001b58.jpeg><p class=align-left>The animal got its name from a Somali phrase that can be translated to ‘giraffe-necked’. Also referred to as the Waller’s Gazelle, this creature resembles an ordinary gazelle. However, you can distinguish it with its long pencil-like neck. This is the rarest of the Northern Five and it takes advantage of the long legs and neck by reaching for food in shrubs and trees.</p><p class=align-left>These herbivores feed on flowers, fruit, and leaves by yanking branches toward them as opposed to eating closer to the ground. They are relatively shy compared to their counterparts in the antelope family, and live in small hears composed of at eight animals at most.</p><h3>East African Oryx/beisa</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0ebf6153be6c92b2.jpeg><p class=align-left>Resembling a cross between a gazelle and a goat, the Baisa can be easily spotted due to their large horns that look like antlers. Their color ranges from white, black to brown, and stay in the semi-desert and savanna climates that characterizes their northern habitat. Just like camels, the animals have adapted genetically and can preserve a lot of water. Also, they cannot sweat at temperatures below 116 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4017ef26659b8f26.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing revelations concerning the giant snakes on the planet</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Another notable behaviour of the species is that there’s usually an alpha bull or head cow that is usually in charge of the herd.</p><h3>Reticulated giraffe</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/79d2195ea48dbe84.jpeg><p class=align-left>With their noteworthy long neck, this giraffe species is also among the common sightings in the north of the equator. These animals use their necks to obtain fruit and leaves in the top acacia trees, and you can identify a tree that has just been feasted on. This is because the animal tends to eat from the top where they can find the freshest leaves, leaving the trees looking a bit like hats.</p><p class=align-left>They’re hardly ever seen drinking water, and look quite funny when they do. Their long necks combined with powerful eyes make for good eyesight.</p><p class=align-left>Each of these animals is unique and you can distinguish them by the pattern of spots in their bodies that slightly differ. The darker the spots, the older the animal.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/430abbaa53e0b4be.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of the top flower farms in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>Grevy’s zebra</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/64fa855db0f7419c.jpeg><p class=align-left>With the easy to identify stripes, these are among the country’s beloved and well-known animals. The Grevy’s Zebra, on the other hand, is the largest in the species and has several features that make it different from the normal zebra. For instance, it has more stripes than the common ones and also has larger ears. In total, they have 80 stripes and have a stronger sense of sight.</p><p class=align-left>Interestingly, its moniker makes the animal even more unique: It got the name in 1882, named after the then French president, Jules Grevy. He was gifted with one of the special zebras. But unfortunately, it continues to be endangered due to draught and habitat loss. Currently, there are only 2,700 of them in the world and a 11 percent of these are housed in the Lewa Conservancy.</p><h3>Ostrich</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/08c55558409cc7eb.jpeg><p class=align-left>Ostriches are large flightless birds that live in small groups on the plains of Kenya. They lay their eggs in "nests" scratched into the bare earth. Ostriches eat mainly plant material, along with insects.

Regardless, they are among the animals that attract a lot of tourists. Before beginning to wonder why someone would pay to see an ugly animal, here is a list of wildlife in this category.</p><h3>Warthog</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/34172f6201dc0c56.jpeg><p class=align-left>This magnificent animal is a member of the pig family and you can easily recognize it with the ‘warts’ and tusks on the head that are used to dig burrows and extract edible roots from the ground. These are among the most common animals in the country, and they spread in different regions of Kenya. Notably, it is not among the endangered species in Kenya.</p><h3>Marabou stork</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4017ef26659b8f26.jpeg><p class=align-left>With the black wings, hunched stature, pink neck pouch, this is definitely not among the prettiest birds in the country. However, they serve a crucial purpose in the ecosystems by scavenging of foods like carcasses, smaller birds, termites, and many more.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs18k54193rc1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Exploring the Wonders of Kenya: A Comprehensive Guide to the Country’s Main Tourist Attractions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The notable neck pouch is a crucial feature and the bird uses it to produce some distinctive croaking sound mostly heard in the mating season. This bird is also distinguishable for its white tail features that are quite long and a featherless head.</p><h3>White-backed vulture</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/bd30571a18949128.jpeg><p class=align-left>The bird got its name from the white-feathered back, but the rest of the body is covered with gray. Just like other members of the vulture family, the bird scavenges on animal carcasses and does not have natural predators. You will notice them circling around plain areas and open savanna to identify potential food.</p><p class=align-left>After sighting blood from a kill, it will sound an alarm to notify other vultures and soon they will be on the ground alongside others such as jackals, hyenas etc. The iconic bird doesn’t fear snatching food from lionesses or cheetahs, but they will never get on the way of the ‘king of the jungle.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c014c3f10ea92472.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>12 African mythical creatures and their legends, folklore</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They may not have predators, but the birds are still endangered due to habitat loss and irresponsible hunting.</p><h3>Spotted hyena</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/430abbaa53e0b4be.jpeg><p class=align-left>Due to their caricature depiction in the movie ‘The Lion King’, these animals are usually associated with scheming ways and an evil crackle. But there’s more to the misunderstood species than meets the eye. These creatures are remarkably strong, have keen hunting skills and powerful jaws. They prey on various animals in the Kenyan wilderness such as zebras, antelopes or even buffaloes.</p><p class=align-left>Moreover, they are fast hunters and can clock speeds of up to 37 miles per hour in short bursts to catch prey. They live as a complex matriarchal society in clans and they use certain sounds to unite the members together in case of danger or when there is a hunt afoot. The small pups (six-month-olds and below) are not part of the hunt and they remain under the watch of some adult females.</p><h3>Wildebeest</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/ebe1fd30c61b01a1.jpeg><p class=align-left>The grazing wildebeest is among the most popular wildlife in the country. This has been facilitated by the annual Mara migration where the animals, alongside different other grazers, migrate in search of pastures leading to a natural spectacle. Also known as ‘gnu’, the wildebeest is related to both cows and antelopes.</p><h2>Exotic wildlife species in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>Kenya is home to lots of forests, savanna, national parks and reserves, and all these ecosystems serve as homes to plenty of plant and animal species. Notably, a good number of these organisms aren’t indigenous in the country, but have grown to become part of the country’s wildlife heritage. Here are some good examples.</p><h3>The Sitatunga</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/93b7ca4555aaa124.jpeg><p class=align-left>Also referred to as the marshbuck, the antelope species is mainly found in swampy areas. It is believed that the amazing herbivore originated from central African countries like Cameroon and the DRC. What distinguishes the antelopes from most others in the same family is their semi-aquatic nature and the fact that they are comfortable in water.</p><p class=align-left>You can find them in Saiwa Swamp National Park, a few miles from the agricultural town of Kitale.
