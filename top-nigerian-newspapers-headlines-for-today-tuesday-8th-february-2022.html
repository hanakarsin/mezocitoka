style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to Naija News roundup of top newspapers headlines in Nigeria for today, Tuesday, 8th February 2022</h2><p>President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday returned to Nigeria after participating in the 35th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Heads and Government of African Union held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</p><p>The President had joined other African leaders to discuss issues about the continent during their meeting held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</p><p>The news of the President’s departure from Addis Ababa to Abuja was shared on the official Facebook page of the government (Aso Rock Villa) alongside pictures of him departing the East African country.</p><p>In an update across the various social media pages of the federal government, pictures of the President’s arrival in Abuja were also shared.</p><p>Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has denied planning to declare his intentions to run for the presidency in 2023 immediately after the All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention, Naija News has learned.</p><p>It would be recalled that reports surfaced online on Monday claiming that Osinbajo will declare his presidential ambition after he made up his mind to join the presidential race that has the likes of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, Senator Rochas Okorocha and Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State.</p><p>According to the reports, the vice president decided to announce his presidential bid following a high-level discussion with President Muhammadu Buhari and some party stakeholders.</p><p>However, in a statement through his spokesman, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo clarified that the report making the rounds is false and speculative snippets.</p><p>He maintained that any information on the action of the Vice President will come directly from his office and not media speculations.</p><p>The Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, on Monday claimed that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government will bring back Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Igboho, after his prosecution in the Benin Republic.</p><p>Malami made this claim while speaking during an interview on Channels TV on Monday.</p><p>The Department of State Services had declared Igboho wanted for allegedly stockpiling arms in his residence an allegation he denied.</p><p>Luck, however, ran out on Igboho after he was arrested at a Benin airport when he tried to board a Germany-bound flight.</p><p>Igboho had since been remanded in a prison in the Benin Republic for over six months where he is said to be facing trial for immigration-related offences, amongst others.</p><p>Malami while speaking on Igboho’s ordeal on Monday said he is been tried based on account of breaching laws in the Benin Republic.</p><p>Former Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi has warned that Nigeria will face deeper challenges in the build-up and after the 2023 general elections.</p><p>The former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) warned on Monday that the country is “living on extra time.”</p><p>Naija News reports Sanusi made the declarations at a reception marking the 80th birthday of Babanla Adinni of Egbaland, Chief Tayo Sowunmi, in Abeokuta, Ogun State.</p><p>The former monarch stated further that Nigeria needs good politicians and other members of the society including pastors, imams, civil servants, and others who will be ready to operate in the fear of God and good conscience.</p><p>He said in the coming years, difficult decisions would have to be made.</p><p>The Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, on Monday disclosed that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government and the United States government are discussing the possible extradition of the suspended head of the Intelligence Response Team, DCP Abba Kyari.</p><p>Abba Kyari is being probed over his alleged role in a $1m scam allegedly perpetrated by disgraced internet fraudster Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi and five others.</p><p>According to Malami, some reasonable grounds for suspicion have been established against Kyari.</p><p>The minister disclosed this on Monday while speaking during an interview on Channels TV.</p><p>Some aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have withdrawn a suit seeking the sack of the National Chairman, Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CEOCPC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai-Mala Buni.</p><p>On Monday the aggrieved members under the aegis of the Progressive Youth Movement (PYM) approached the Federal High Court, Abuja to formally apply for the discontinuance of the case.</p><p>Speaking with reporters outside the court premises, the leader of the movement, Princess Zahrah Mustapha-Audu, said members of the group came to the court to withdraw the case.</p><p>Mustapha-Audu said they filed the suit in view of an existing disagreement within the party, which has since been resolved using the party’s internal mechanism.</p><p>The Nigerian Government has received two million doses of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine donated by the European Union.</p><p>The Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Faisal Shuaib, received the vaccine on behalf of the government on Monday at the National Strategic Cold Store, Abuja.</p><p>Shuaib said the Muhammadu Buhari government has procured over 39 million doses of the J&J vaccine, through the AFREXIM bank in combating the pandemic.</p><p>The NPHCDA boss added that only about 12 million doses of this single-shot vaccine are currently in the cold store.</p><p>Shuaib said the single-shot J&J vaccine was received through the African Vaccine Acquisition Team (AVAT) of the African Union, a facility provided by AFREXIMBANK.</p><p>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the confirmation of Professor Rhoda Gumus as a National Commissioner for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) by the Senate.</p><p>The major opposition party in a statement on Monday described the development as a coup against democracy.</p><p>The PDP statement signed by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Debo Ologunagba said it is clear Gumus is a card-carrying member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) which should have automatically disqualified her from the position.</p><p>Naija News recalls Gumus is one of the six persons the Senate last Wednesday confirmed their nomination as National Commissioners for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p><p>Also confirmed is the nomination of one person as a Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) for the electoral umpire.</p><p>But the PDP says the Senate took the wrong step by confirming her despite the public outcry against her nomination.</p><p>It also accused President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC of insensitivity and intentionally contravening the provisions of the constitution regarding such appointments.</p><p>The statement warned that there is no way Gumus can operate without bias since she’s a card-carrying member of the APC.</p><p>The Nigerian Army Headquarters has confirmed receiving no fewer than 104 fighters of the Islamic State’s West Africa Province, ISWAP, who surrendered themselves to troops in Borno.</p><p>The said former terrorists and their family members reportedly include 22 males, 27 females and 55 children.</p><p>Naija News reports that the development was disclosed on Monday morning via the social media page of the Nigerian Army.</p><p>The post reads, “ISWAP and their families numbering 104 comprising 22 males, 27 females and 55 children surrendered to troops of 25 Task Force Brigade Damboa, Borno State on Saturday 5 February 2022.”</p><p>The governor of Sokoto state, Waziri Aminu Tambuwal has slammed the decision of the Zamfara state House of Assembly to make impeachment moves against the state’s deputy governor, Mahdi Aliyu Gusau.</p><p>The governor made his grievance known on Monday during his visit to Gusau, Zamfara state capital, where he had gone to meet with the party’s stakeholders on his 2023 presidential ambition</p><p>“The matter is in the court and any law-abiding person must allow the law to take its due course,” he said.</p><p>A statement by the Special Adviser Media and Publicity to the Governor, Muhammad Bello explained that the governor’s visit was the second leg of his presidential bid discourse.</p><p>Tambuwal stated that the PDP will regain its place in power in Nigeria and Zamfara in the coming elections, while also stressing that the APC has to leave power to make things in Nigeria work again.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspapers headlines for today.
