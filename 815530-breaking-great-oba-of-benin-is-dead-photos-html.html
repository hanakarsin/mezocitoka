It is customary that when a sitting Oba becomes an ancestor, translates to a greater glory. T‎he Oba of Benin does not die because he is an institution; he mainly translates to a high glory as an ancestor.</i></p><p><i>"The news is first broken to his eldest son and the immediate family which was done earlier today. And the Iyase of Benin, as the highest ranking Chief now breaks the news to the people of Benin Kingdom and the world. Iyase is the traditional Prime Minister and the bridge between the people and the royalty and that is what he has done today.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Ekiti doctors’ death: Grief, tears as protest mar funeral service</p><p><i>"From today until the expiration of ‘Emwinekhua’ all Benin Chiefs, all chiefs that have been entitled by the Oba to wear the round bead round their necks, which is two, will now wear one. It is customary because when you see a Chief wears one bead, it shows that we are in a state of mourning. After today, we are awaiting further instructions on what to do.</i></p><p><i>"Oba&nbsp; Eredia uwa is the Oba of Peace, the Oba who brought prosperity to his people, the Oba who understands his people. He makes sure that no one was offended, the Oba who could sit in judgment and give judgment against his own son for a commoner. It is rare. Oba Erediauwa is the best that has happened to Benin Kingdom in the last 1,600 years."</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt3jfpdfasg2eg.jpeg><p>In reaction to the announcement of the Oba's death, Governor Adams Oshiomhole of Edo state has eulogised the departed Benin Monarch, Oba Erediauwa.&nbsp; The Governor expressed his profound reverence for the departed Monarch in a press statement he issued and personally signed.</p><p>He described the late Monarch as ‎<i>"an accomplished Nigerian, a seasoned bureaucrat, quintessential unifier, unique personage".</i></p><p>Oshiomhole said<i>: "Our hearts are heavy, laden with pains and grief, at the announcement of the passing on to glory of Omo n’Oba n’Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Erediauwa of Benin, our highly revered Oba, a distinguished Edo numero uno, an accomplished Nigerian, a seasoned bureaucrat, quintessential unifier, unique personage and exemplary Omo N’Oba, whose reign brought distinction, immense class, finesse and integrity to traditional institution in Edo state and the country at large.</i></p><p><i>"His carriage comes with an élan that was peculiar with the reverence of royalty. His uncommon courage was symbolic of the can-do spirit of the Edo mind. His unity of purpose was not in doubt even as he used his revered position to promote constructive engagement amongst all shades of opinion and culture in Edo state. As a thorough-bred bureaucrat, rising to the pinnacle of his career as a Federal Permanent Secretary, he understood the dynamics and intricacies of governance. He was the alternative voice to the many voiceless in our society, calling government attention to issues of development and transparent governance, without minding whose ox is gored. He was brave, fearless, punchy and instructive in his verbal and written messages.</i></p><p><i>"To us at the Edo state Government, he was our strongest supporter; both in his uncommon faith in our ability and his readiness to offer uncommon advice to sharpen public discourse in our shared commitment to transform Edo state. It gladdens our heart, therefore, that our revered Oba was alive to witness the positive transformation of Edo state under his reign, and for standing with us through thick and thin in the course of making the Edo economy a treasure to behold. Being part of that eloquent history of transformation before his reunion with his ancestors gives us further reassurance that he will occupy a special pride of place in the hereafter.</i></p><p><i>"We are enveloped with a deep sense of nostalgia that our great Oba, a great-grandfather, grandfather, father, uncle and iconoclastic royal father of exemplary carriage and conduct, who sustained the dignity of the average Edo mind, has joined his ancestors. We are, however, encouraged by the fact that another great son of the Great Benin Kingdom, His Royal Highness, Edaiken N’Uselu, Crown Prince Eheneden Erediauwa, who is already showing manifest quintessential attributes of his great father, will step into his father’s big shoes.</i></p><p>‎</p><p><i>"Edo people will miss our iconoclastic royal father of the great Benin Kingdom. Nigerians and Nigeria will miss this great exemplar of a Royal Father, an Oba of distinction and integrity. Adieu until we meet to part no more.</i></p><p><i>"Oba gha to kpere, ise," </i>the governor concluded.<i></i></p><p>Oba Erediauwa was born in 1923, when in 1979 he ascended the throne of his fathers, he became the 38th Oba of Benin, traditional ruler of the Edo people in Benin City, in Nigeria.</p><p>He was formerly addressed as the Prince Solomon Akenzua, and took on the title Omo n'Oba n'Edo Uku Akpolokpolo Erediauwa I after taking over from his father Oba Akenzua II, in a ceremony held in Benin city, on March 23, 1979.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhXKBlGxnZpqimq6stc2gZKCqlZbBbrvBmmSonl2Xsq%2B1zWagrGWUmq6lec%2Bhpq2no2O1tbnL</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f815530-breaking-great-oba-of-benin-is-dead-photos-html.html&text=BREAKING%3a%20Oba%20of%20Benin%20is%20Dead&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f815530-breaking-great-oba-of-benin-is-dead-photos-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f815530-breaking-great-oba-of-benin-is-dead-photos-html.html&title=BREAKING%3a%20Oba%20of%20Benin%20is%20Dead" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f815530-breaking-great-oba-of-benin-is-dead-photos-html.html&title=BREAKING%3a%20Oba%20of%20Benin%20is%20Dead" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f815530-breaking-great-oba-of-benin-is-dead-photos-html.html&title=BREAKING%3a%20Oba%20of%20Benin%20is%20Dead" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f815530-breaking-great-oba-of-benin-is-dead-photos-html.html&description=BREAKING%3a%20Oba%20of%20Benin%20is%20Dead" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./connie-stevens-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Connie Stevens - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jason-meyers-teacher-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Ex English Teacher Jason Meyers Now?
