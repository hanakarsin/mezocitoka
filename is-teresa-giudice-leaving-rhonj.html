And for many <a href=#>Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> viewers, the first person that comes to mind is Miss “Namaste” herself — <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a>.</p><p>Teresa has been with RHONJ since Season 1 and has only left during her time away at “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">camp</a>,” better known to the rest of us as her 11-month stay in prison for multiple counts of fraud.</p><p>Since returning from serving time, Teresa declared she was committing to maintaining her Bravo reign until the end. However, after a challenging Season 13 of RHONJ for the mother of four and her second husband, <a href=#>Louie Ruelas</a>, rumors circulated that she might leave. Despite these rumors, Teresa stayed on for Season 14, leaving fans wondering if she has the stamina to continue. In a July 2024 interview, Teresa finally addressed the rumors, which should put them to rest for good. Here's what she said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Teresa Giudice leaving ‘The Real Housewives of New Jersey’?</h2><p>No, Teresa isn't leaving RHONJ and doesn't plan on going anywhere until Bravo gives her the boot. During a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">July 2024 interview</a> on Live With Kelly & Mark, Kelly brought up the rumors about Teresa leaving the show, which Teresa suggested may have stemmed from her castmates. However, she clarified for fans, "No, I'm not leaving." She added, "When Bravo wants me to leave, that’s when I’ll leave."</p><p>While Teresa will continue with the series, she won't be present for the RHONJ Season 14 reunion—and that's because there won't be one. After a disastrous Season 13 reunion, where many cast members yelled over each other, Bravo decided to ax the reunion. However, Teresa says there will be a closing show to wrap up the season, so fans should stay tuned.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Teresa Giudice intends on moving to a new state. Here’s how it might affect her 'RHONJ' role.</h2><p>Although Teresa has made it clear she’s not leaving Bravo, she could potentially join another Real Housewives franchise due to her planned move. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BravoTV.com</a>, she was asked if <a href=#>her New Jersey home</a> was her forever home, to which she replied, “No, we’re looking at properties now. It’s between California and Florida.”</p><p>Teresa explained that once Adriana graduates high school, they plan to split the year between New Jersey and their new home, which could be in California or Florida. She emphasized wanting warm weather year-round and noted that Adriana hopes to attend the University of Miami. If accepted, it could sway Teresa and Luis’s decision to move to Florida.</p><p>So, what could this mean for her role on RHONJ? If she divides her time between states, she might remain an active cast member. However, given the ongoing drama and feuds on the show, it might be worth considering joining another franchise.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TERESA GIUDICE ® (@teresagiudice)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">And now for a recap of the "memorable" moments from the brutal Season 13 of 'RHONJ'</h2><p>With Season 13 standing out as one of the more memorable seasons of the show, we thought it made sense to recap some of those heated moments that likely fueled rumors Teresa would eventually leave.</p><p>RHONJ Season 13 saw Teresa planning her wedding and trying to find peace, but the feud between her, Joe, and Melissa continued.</p><p>Teresa fought with <a href=#>Melissa and Joe over Teresa's wedding</a>, a <a href=#>failed pizza oven idea</a>, and <a href=#>allegations of cheating</a> and abuse from both parties.</p><p>The finale revealed that Louie had hired a private investigator, <a href=#>Bo Dietl</a>, to find information about Melissa, Joe, and several other cast members, which Louie has since denied.</p><p>During the final part of the Season 13 reunion three-part special, Melissa made another claim about Tre, including her eldest daughter, <a href=#>Gia</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Melissa said Teresa’s daughter told Joe he could “do better” than Melissa.</h2><p>The accusation was so vile that Teresa called her then 22-year-old daughter from Coachella to share her side of the story. Gia denied ever insulting her aunt Melissa. She said she told her uncle to do better and honor <a href=#>their late parents</a> by walking Teresa down the aisle in their father Nonno’s place. Gia also shamed Joe for calling her a liar.</p><p>Following Gia’s call, Melissa and Joe doubled down on their claim that they didn’t make the story up, with Melissa asking, “Why would he ever make that up?” Teresa quickly replied to Melissa’s question with “because he’s married to you,” before telling Joe she couldn’t “understand” how her brother fell out, stating, “I was always good to you.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lucia Stephanina Casazza (@luciacasazza)</a></p></figure><p>Teresa and Joe continued going back and forth as Tre reminded her brother they were once “best friends.” Then, after a few moments, Teresa jumped out of her seat, said she couldn’t take the drama anymore, and called the situation “disgusting” before walking out of the reunion.</p><p>“This is not the way I would raise my children,” Teresa says while walking away and calling out their "Mommy and Daddy." “You should be ashamed of yourself.”</p><p>Teresa yelled, “Don’t come following me!” to the cameras as Louie followed her to her dressing room. Backstage, the couple calls Gia again and shares how done they are with Melissa and Joe. Thankfully, after talking with Andy, Teresa returned to the stage to finish the reunion.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Bravo (@bravotv)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Teresa’s feud with Melissa has not been resolved and the two are now estranged.</h2><p>Although fans will continue to see Teresa appear in future seasons of RHONJ, they shouldn't expect any joyous scenes with Melissa and Joe moving forward.</p><p>After Teresa returned to the reunion stage, she clarified that she wanted nothing to do with her brother or Melissa ever again.
