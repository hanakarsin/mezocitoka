The duo’s often debatable approaches to relationships and getting to the bag have resulted in chart-topping success, a talk show for Yung Miami, and a Max show loosely based on the Miami natives’ rise to fame (<a href=#>BRING BACK RAP SH!T</a>).</p><p>JT and Yung Miami have always seemed to have an unbreakable that began in high school. However, the duo was in the throughs of another 2024 female rap beef. How did it start? Here’s the scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">JT and Yung Miami’s beef started when one accused the other of “sneak dissing” online.</h2><p>Before I get into the drama between the “Town Women” (<a href=#>IYKYK</a>), I want to say I am in no way choosing sides. Seeing the rap girlies squabble is never fun, especially when they’re supposed to be on the same team.</p><p>Alas, if you feel like your friend is talking about you behind your back, you might want to express your grievances online like Yung Miami did.</p><p>On April 8, 2024, Miami <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a tweet</a>, via Complex, “A b---h has been sneak dissing me for weeks, and I ain't say shit what a bitch mad at me fa?????!!!!!!” She then added, “I ain't jealous of a soul; I'm always like, go bitch go!!! I clap for everybody, and I show love to EVERYBODY !! It ain't a b---h I haven't shown love to!!!!!!”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>While Miami didn’t name the person she was referring to, JT took the tweet personally and addressed her friend in a quote tweet. She warned Miami that the day was her last of “playing dumb” and said she felt Miami enjoyed seeing her “dragged” by their haters and was never supportive of her career. Miami denied JT’s statements, saying JT, “LET THE INTERNET PUT IN YOUR HEAD THAT IM JEALOUS OF YOU!”</p><p>The Twitter war between the “Act Up” artists ran for hours and included Miami accusing JT of also sneak dissing her on her songs <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“No Bars</a>” and “Sideways.”</p><p>JT denied this, stating that the internet made Miami believe the songs were about her. She noted that “No Bars” was released under City Girls and not JT alone. Miami replied by calling JT “weird” and always making her the bad guy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by CITY ON LOCK 💖🌃🔒 (@citygirls)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">JT and Caresha agreed they still "love" one another.</h2><p>After hours of arguing on social media and subjecting themselves to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter discourse</a>, JT and Yung Miami finally seemed ready to squash their short-lived feud—but only after one more misunderstanding occurred between them.</p><p>At 6:15 p.m. on April 8, JT posted a tweet implying she wanted her and Miami’s beef to continue. The tweet showed JT responding to Miami by stating she had always supported her friend’s projects outside the group, including her Revolt talk show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Caresha Please!</a></p><p>“If I'm ever mad, I have a reason to be behind closed doors. You have done stuff to me that you think I should just get over,” JT wrote. “You never come to my defense when I would've literally taken a bullet for you! When CP [Caresha Please] popped off I was there 1st episode, & when someone canceled, I showed up in a red wig! Keep calling me mad like the internet does, but you know me, my heart pumps Gold! I wish you the best always & I love how fast you got on here behind <a href=#>[Saucy] Santana</a>!”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me to Yung Miami & Jt right now 😣 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zPTkysfICH</a></p>— AshCash 🤍♊️ (@Jeld4life) <a href=#>April 8, 2024</a></figure><p>Miami quickly quote-tweeted JT and scolded her for continuing to air their dirty laundry, stating, “Jatavia, we just got off the phone. I'm so confused now. Are we back to the internet??????” JT shut down any inklings of throwing shade and told Miami the tweet was supposed to come out before their phone conversation.</p><p>The longtime friends seemingly ended their animosity by calling a truce on Twitter (where else?). Miami said she was “moving on” from drama and that she loved JT, with JT replying, “I love you more; I actually love you the most.” The duo also deleted their tweets on their respective accounts.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Are City Girls breaking up?</h2><p>Several months after their Twitter battle, City Girls fans hoped JT and Miami were ready to get back into the studio. Unfortunately, they will have to continue waiting, as the duo has decided to shift their focus to their solo projects.</p><p>In June 2024, Miami confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a> that she and JT were in "two different spaces," which manifested during their possible final joint album, Raw.</p><p style=text-align:start>The whole rollout for the album was bad because we were just in two different spaces," Miami explained. "You know, like, we older now and [JT] was doing her own thing. She's on the West Coast, I’m in Miami. I’m doing my own thing. And I felt like naturally, when she doing her own thing, it just worked for her. And when I’m doing my own thing, it worked for me. But when we get together as a group, it just wasn’t connecting. It just wasn’t working no more. So I think we both were at a point where we were just like, ‘We probably should just do our own s--t.’”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yung Miami speaks about putting out solo music after the City Girls album 🎵 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TyjY5PBbVm</a></p>— Complex Music (@ComplexMusic) <a href=#>June 3, 2024</a></figure><p>Miami also said she was looking forward to shutting down the "trolls" who didn't feel she could be a successful solo act. She also addressed her and JT's Twitter spat with Complex and confirmed that, despite their back-and-forth, they love one another, and their drama "ain’t never that deep where it’ll go farther than that."</p><p>As Miami mentioned in their Twitter spat, she’s going through a lot amid her name being mentioned in <a href=#>Diddy’s sexual assault, human, and drug trafficking lawsuits</a>.</p><p>JT is also pursuing solo shows, though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a> reported she wants nothing to stop the group she and Miami created.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn8FuxdSnnmalmZa6qnnBnpyfZZWtva2tyKecnQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjt-yung-miami-beef-explained.html&text=JT%20and%20Yung%20Miamis%20Beef%20Explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjt-yung-miami-beef-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjt-yung-miami-beef-explained.html&title=JT%20and%20Yung%20Miamis%20Beef%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjt-yung-miami-beef-explained.html&title=JT%20and%20Yung%20Miamis%20Beef%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjt-yung-miami-beef-explained.html&title=JT%20and%20Yung%20Miamis%20Beef%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjt-yung-miami-beef-explained.html&description=JT%20and%20Yung%20Miamis%20Beef%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-circle-tv.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Circle TV Network Is No More, but Its Programming Is All Streaming Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./273809-ahmednasir-abdullahi-biography-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ahmednasir Abdullahi biography - Tuko.co.ke">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
