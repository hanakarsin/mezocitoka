Each winner gets a record contract with a major label, and many have also received cash prizes for their victory as well.&nbsp;</p><p>To date, 17 winners have been awarded on the show, but what’s happened to all of them since their victories?&nbsp;Are they still pursuing careers in music, have any made it to the big time, or have they taken a different route altogether? Find out below!&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 1: Javier Colon</h2><p>Javier Colon left his deal with Universal Republic Records in 2014, and signed with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Concord Music Group</a> the same year. The singer released his fourth album in 2016, and went on tour with that album. More recently, Javier has performed in on-stage productions at a repertory theater in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecticut</a> and with the Charleston Symphony Orchestra for Broadway Under the Stars.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 2: Jermaine Paul</h2><p>Jermaine Paul’s debut album, which was supposed to drop in 2015, never actually came out. Since then, his career seems to have stalled, although he has participated in lower-profile events like fundraisers, and a performance at The Theater at North in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pennsylvania</a> in December of 2017.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 3: Cassadee Pope</h2><p>Cassadee Pope was the first Voice winner to receive a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammy nomination</a>. That nomination came in 2015 for her duet with Chris Young on “Think of You.” She also released her EP “Summer” in 2016, and has performed the national anthem at a NASCAR Race and an NFL game. Cassadee released her second album in 2019, and also participated in the “CMT Next Women of Country Tour.“&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 4: Danielle Bradbery</h2><p>Since winning The Voice, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danielle</a> has released the singles “Friend Zone” and “Sway.” In 2017, she also released her sophomore album, "I Don’t Believe We’ve Met." The album hit No. 6 on the Top Country Charts, and also received generally positive reviews.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 5: Tessanne Chin</h2><p>Tessanne received more votes than any other contestant in the show’s history, but she’s been relatively quiet in recent years. She’s said to be working on a new album, although the timing of that album is still unclear. She released her first album in 2014, and followed it up with two Jamaican R&B singles in 2015 and 2016.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 6: Josh Kaufman</h2><p>Josh became the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">oldest</a> winner in Voice history after winning at 38. Since his win, the singer has released a self-titled EP and performed in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadway</a> Show Home for the Holidays: Live on Broadway.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 7: Craig Wayne Boyd</h2><p>Craig parted ways with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dot Records</a>, his record company, after releasing just one single, “My Baby’s Got a Smile On Her Face.” The song shot to No.1 on the Billboard Country charts, but his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">next single</a> peaked at No. 35. He signed with Copperline Music Group in 2017, and finally released his debut album in October of that year.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 8: Sawyer Fredericks</h2><p>Immediately after his victory, Sawyer had a number of hits on the Billboard folk chart. In 2017, he announced that he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving</a> Republic Records as well as his management company in order to become an independent artist. In March of 2018, he independently released his latest album, "Hide Your Ghost."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 9: Jordan Smith</h2><p>Jordan has already released three albums and performed at the People’s Choice Awards. The singer released "Something Beautiful," his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">debut album</a>, in 2016. The album peaked at No. 2 on the iTunes sales charts. He also released a holiday album that year, and followed that up with his sophomore album "Only Love" in 2018.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 10: Alisan Porter</h2><p>Alisan Porter was the first artist to win The Voice with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">female coach</a>.

She also released the single “Come This Far” in May of 2018. In 2019, she changed her stage name to Chloe MK and released “To Be Young” under that new name. She also toured with Sizzy Rocket.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 14: Brynn Cartelli</h2><p>Still the youngest person to ever win on the show, Brynn has kept busy in the relatively brief period since she won the show. She released her first single, “Late Night’s Mascara” in 2018, and she also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">toured</a> with coach Kelly Clarkson and Kelsea Ballerini. She’s also returned to the show for three separate performances.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 15: Chevel Shepherd</h2><p>Since becoming Kelly Clarkson’s second straight winner, Chevel has signed with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Republic Records</a> and booked a slew of performances. She released a single, “Broken Hearts,” in 2018 that charted on the Billboard Country charts.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 16: Maelyn Jarmon</h2><p>Having just won The Voice in May of 2019, Maelyn hasn’t had a ton of time to create a name for herself. She did release “Wait For You,” a single she debuted on the show, and it charted at No. 24 on the US Digital chart.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 17: Jake Hoot</h2><p>Jake is the most recent Voice winner, and has only been off the show for roughly two months.
