He's lost his daughter as well as a consequence of his own actions.</p><p>'It is tragic for the victim of this murder and a tragedy for the daughter and for the father too. It is his own fault, I know, but that is not going to make it easier for her.'</p><p>Passing sentence Judge Andrew Gilbart QC told Adebiyi it was not clear exactly when he had killed Esther.</p><p>He added: 'Your relationship had come to an end with frequent disagreements and rows between the two of you.</p><p>'She formed a relationship with another man. You resented it, and tried to warn him off with threats.</p><p>'She let you know that she no longer wanted to be with you and wanted to pursue a relationship with another man.</p><p>'You were most upset at that prospect. She sought friendship elsewhere, including in an affair with another man. You were understandably upset but let me be clear about this.</p><p>'Many men and women have to endure the discovery that the husband, wife or partner is no longer content with the relationship they have.</p><p>'Many are jealous or unhappy. But what the law cannot and will not permit is the use of violence, which is what you used.</p><p>'I am prepared to accept that you were very upset - and indeed distraught - at what was happening to your relationship.</p><p>'When you acted as you did you were under considerable emotional strain.'</p><p>After the case Senior Investigator Andrew Tattersall of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The biggest tragedy here is that a young girl has now been deprived of both her parents.</p><p>'Her mother was taken from her in a vengeful, violent attack and no sentence today can bring her back.'&nbsp;</p><p>But the following morning Adebiyi was said to have made 'frantic arrangements' to get child care for his daughter and handed her over at 9.50am along with her birth certificate and left in her push chair.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfneEj2ploaydoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f16801-html.html&text=Christian%20Woman%20Murdered%20By%20Muslim%20Ex-boyfriend%20For%20Challenging%20Him%20Over%20Daughter%27s%20Conversion%20To%20Is&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f16801-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f16801-html.html&title=Christian%20Woman%20Murdered%20By%20Muslim%20Ex-boyfriend%20For%20Challenging%20Him%20Over%20Daughter%27s%20Conversion%20To%20Is" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f16801-html.html&title=Christian%20Woman%20Murdered%20By%20Muslim%20Ex-boyfriend%20For%20Challenging%20Him%20Over%20Daughter%27s%20Conversion%20To%20Is" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f16801-html.html&title=Christian%20Woman%20Murdered%20By%20Muslim%20Ex-boyfriend%20For%20Challenging%20Him%20Over%20Daughter%27s%20Conversion%20To%20Is" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f16801-html.html&description=Christian%20Woman%20Murdered%20By%20Muslim%20Ex-boyfriend%20For%20Challenging%20Him%20Over%20Daughter%27s%20Conversion%20To%20Is" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./416127-kenyan-celebrities-celebrate-fathers-day-with-different-messages-online-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kenyan Celebrities Celebrate Father's Day With Heartwarming Messages Online">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./90-day-fiance-before-the-90-days-cast.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'90 Day Fianc: Before the 90 Days:' A Who's Who of the Cast">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
