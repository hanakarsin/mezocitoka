Below, we take a look at Wayne's love life, including his coming out as <a href=#>pansexual</a> in 2023.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Wayne Brady married?</h2><p>Nope, Wayne isn't married and it looks like he's single, but he has been married twice before.

He even quarantined during the pandemic with Mandie, their daughter (more on her in a moment!), and Mandie's boyfriend Jason.</p><p>"My ex-wife Mandie and I, we have a different and I think a very special relationship than a lot of people who co-parent," Wayne explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo</a> in April 2020.</p><p>"We’ve also lived like seven minutes away from each other at the most," he added. "Right now, we live literally next door to each other. So our quarantining is a little different. We quarantine between both of our homes and I’ve got a big backyard and lots of land so we both share this land and this space."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Wayne Brady (@mrbradybaby)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Wayne Brady have kids?</h2><p>Wayne and Mandie co-parent a daughter named Maile, who is Wayne's only child.
