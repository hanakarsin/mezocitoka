But it's even more terrible when you are a professor bad-mouthing your student in an email you accidentally send to them. It's wildly unprofessional.</p><p>But that's what happened to Skye, who shared screenshots of her email exchange with her professor, Anne Roschelle. Skye emailed her to politely let her know that the pricing information she provided for class materials was incorrect and to suggest that she offer the readings digitally. Anne's response shocked her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>GUYS IVE GRADUATED SO NOW I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE</p><p>My senior seminar professor (and the chair of women’s gender and sexuality) wrote an email about me, meant to send it to other professors, and send it TO ME</p><p>Ironically, the seminar was on poverty and homelessness <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vkkgl6EADB</a></p>— s̑̈k̑̈y̑̈ȇ̈ (@skyeaxe) <a href=#>August 31, 2020</a></figure><p>Anne wrote, "Check out this entitled student — ballsy," and meant to send Skye's email around to other teachers, which is unprofessional to begin with, but then she accidentally included Skye on the email!</p><p>Skye was confused at first, thinking the email was just to her. Then she realized Anne had sent it to a bunch of other professors, including the chair of Skye's major department and even some people who didn't even teach at the school. Skye worked up the courage to respond and swiftly dropped the class because she knew she couldn't have a good experience after this debacle.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>At first I was terrified. I thought the email was just to me</p><p>And then I realized she sent it to a whole slew of people, including people not even teaching at the school AND the chair of my major’s department and I lost it <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mUeSNvdmJC</a></p>— s̑̈k̑̈y̑̈ȇ̈ (@skyeaxe) <a href=#>August 31, 2020</a></figure><p>"Actually, I see you were trying to talk about me to other professors so I will be dropping your class. You are very mean and have a sense of arrogance and self-righteousness that is beyond belief! Good luck with your book and have a fantastic semester," Skye wrote.</p><p>At this point, you'd think Anne would be mortified to learn what she'd done, that she'd apologize profusely and grovel at Skye's feet for forgiveness. But you can probably guess that that is not what happened.&nbsp;</p><p>It's clear from Anne's response that she does not view students as whole human beings deserving of respect. She is dismissive and rude and barely apologizes for her grievous mistake.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’ve never had any issue with my sociology professors, so for this to happen I was deeply hurt and frustrated.<br>Imagine being so close minded while constantly gloating about being an activist?

"My point is that I have pedagogical reasons for having you purchase the packet of readings. It's not just about money but about how students learn.&nbsp;</p><p>"There are a variety of learning styles that need to be accommodated. I realize school is expensive — most classes require around $100 per class for books — I try to keep costs lower if I can.</p><p>"Having said that — you should reflect on the tone of your message and the way you engaged me — I experienced it as you telling me how to run my class which [f]elt inappropriate and disrespectful."&nbsp;</p><p>Anne is supposedly a successful activist and writer, but it seems she needs some help with reading comprehension because nothing about Skye's email was disrespectful. I can only imagine how furious Skye was to receive this email because I'm fuming right now. The worst part is that Anne still sits on her high horse, thinking she did nothing wrong and that Skye was the one in the wrong.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>In her thread, which went viral, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Skye writes</a>, "I loved my time at New Paltz, but watch out friends, I love you and want you all to have positive learning experiences. This is so ridiculously unprofessional and she really made it so I wasn't comfortable staying in the class. Y'all deserve better."</p><p>Skye's thread sparked a renewal in people emailing the school to complain about Anne Roschelle's behavior, and while it's unclear what became of the situation, but Skye assures everyone that the school knows about the incident. Let's hope she has been held accountable for her behavior.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpb%2BwssSsqqiqXZawpLXDnqWtmZyhxm6xzJqgpatdqMG2sMSnqw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fprofessor-accidentally-emails-student.html&text=Professor%20Accidentally%20Emails%20Student%20Calling%20Her%20%27Entitled%27%20and%20%27Ballsy%27%20for%20Correcting%20Her&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprofessor-accidentally-emails-student.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprofessor-accidentally-emails-student.html&title=Professor%20Accidentally%20Emails%20Student%20Calling%20Her%20%27Entitled%27%20and%20%27Ballsy%27%20for%20Correcting%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fprofessor-accidentally-emails-student.html&title=Professor%20Accidentally%20Emails%20Student%20Calling%20Her%20%27Entitled%27%20and%20%27Ballsy%27%20for%20Correcting%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fprofessor-accidentally-emails-student.html&title=Professor%20Accidentally%20Emails%20Student%20Calling%20Her%20%27Entitled%27%20and%20%27Ballsy%27%20for%20Correcting%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprofessor-accidentally-emails-student.html&description=Professor%20Accidentally%20Emails%20Student%20Calling%20Her%20%27Entitled%27%20and%20%27Ballsy%27%20for%20Correcting%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./allison-hunt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Allison Hunt - Distractify">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./natalie-odell-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Natalie Odell - Age, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
