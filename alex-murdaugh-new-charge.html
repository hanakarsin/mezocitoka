Now he has a jail contraband charge to add to a list of extensive charges against him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: AP</a></figure><p>Alex Murdaugh has been <a href=#>on trial</a> for the murder of his wife Maggie and his son Paul for a month, and was just brought up on a new charge.</p><p>First, a little background. Maggie and Paul's bodies were found near the family's dog kennels on June 7, 2021. They had been killed with multiple gunshot wounds.</p><p>But unbelievably, double homicide is not the only charge Alex faces. Let's take a look at the tangled web of charges against the former prominent lawyer, as well as the latest, new charge.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the new charge against Alex Murdaugh?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Fox</a></figure><p>On February 24, 2023, a new warrant was issued that charged Alex with possession of jailhouse contraband. While it is a misdemeanor, and we don't know what the contraband was, Alex has admitted to struggling with drug addiction. Indeed, it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that Alex may have received contraband smuggled in through a book given to him either by a <a href=#>family</a> member at trial or at a lunch meeting with his attorneys.</p><p>We don't know if this new charge will affect the decision of the jury, who will decide Alex's fate soon. But there are so many other charges to consider it could make your head spin.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What are the details of Alex Murdaugh's charges?</h2><p>Alex is accused of upwards of 70 fraud, drug, and financial charges in addition to the murders. He was indicted on two weapons possession charges. His financial crimes total multiple millions of dollars, with dozens of charges brought from multiple separate indictments, as he's accused of embezzling funds from clients at his family's personal injury law firm to pay personal debts.</p><p>A botched roadside shooting incident also resulted in other charges against him.</p><p>The estates of the deceased Murdaugh family members are also being sued for the wrongful death of <a href=#>Mallory Beach</a>, who was killed during a <a href=#>boating accident</a> in 2019. Paul, who was allegedly extremely intoxicated, had been driving the doomed vessel.</p><p>Meanwhile, prosecutor <a href=#>Creighton Waters</a> said in court that Alex lied “easily and convincingly” to people in his life, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Post and Courier</a>. "For the first time in your life of privilege and prominence and wealth, when you were facing accountability, each time suddenly, you became a victim, and everyone ran to your aid," Creighton also said of Alex during the cross examination.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Court is back in session and lead prosecutor Creighton Waters has resumed his extensive cross-examination of Alex Murdaugh.</p><p>Follow this thread for updates from the double murder trial.<a href=#>https://t.co/RmPs6sdoe0</a></p>— The Post and Courier (@postandcourier) <a href=#>February 24, 2023</a></figure><p>Whether the jury finds Alex guilty or innocent of his charges, the proceedings will continue Monday, February 27, 2023. If Alex is found guilty of murdering Paul and Maggie, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AP News</a>, the sentence is expected to be 30 years in jail. If he is found not guilty, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a> expects the disgraced former attorney will still spend decades behind bars due to the other charges against him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmmxIymrKuckaq0qXnNnq5mm5iWv6ix</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falex-murdaugh-new-charge.html&text=Alex%20Murdaugh%20Faces%20a%20New%20Charge%20During%20His%20Double%20Homicide%20Trial.%20What%20Is%20It%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falex-murdaugh-new-charge.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falex-murdaugh-new-charge.html&title=Alex%20Murdaugh%20Faces%20a%20New%20Charge%20During%20His%20Double%20Homicide%20Trial.%20What%20Is%20It%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falex-murdaugh-new-charge.html&title=Alex%20Murdaugh%20Faces%20a%20New%20Charge%20During%20His%20Double%20Homicide%20Trial.%20What%20Is%20It%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falex-murdaugh-new-charge.html&title=Alex%20Murdaugh%20Faces%20a%20New%20Charge%20During%20His%20Double%20Homicide%20Trial.%20What%20Is%20It%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falex-murdaugh-new-charge.html&description=Alex%20Murdaugh%20Faces%20a%20New%20Charge%20During%20His%20Double%20Homicide%20Trial.%20What%20Is%20It%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./edward-rowe-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Edward Rowe - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./october18-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="October 18 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
