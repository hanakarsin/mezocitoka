To me, what is happening to Tinubu is a judgment of God. You think you can appropriate the whole country’s resources like he did in Lagos state to your own family,”</p><p>According to the former Deputy National Chairman of the PDP, Tinubu’s time to pay for his wrongs is already near and would have to vomit everything he has stolen from the government.</p><p><strong>Naija News,&nbsp;</strong>however, understands that Tinubu in a recent statement said that he hadn’t concluded yet on picking the 2023 presidential form. He noted that his focused at the moment is to support citizens on the economic crisis caused as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Reacting to the previously rumoured claims, Chef George while addressing newsmen in an interview on Monday morning said;&nbsp;“From the very beginning, I used to tell them that the party APC is a congregation of strange bedfellows. When you have a big party like that and someone wants to hijack it, there will be a problem.”</p><p>“First of all, it is a misnomer in a presidential system for a man who is not elected into any position to come out and say he is the National leader of the party.”</p><p>“How is that possible? There is only one National leader of the party and that is the President. How can a ragamuffin from somewhere just wake up and say he is the National leader and not the President? What does that mean?</p><p>“We saw the way Chief John Odigie- Oyegun was removed as national chairman. To me, what is happening to Tinubu is a judgment of God. You think you can appropriate the whole country’s resources like he did in Lagos state to your own family?”&nbsp;Chief George expressed his concern.</p><p>He added, “It cannot work! I believe nemesis is catching up with Tinubu. We warned him but he refused to listen. The Yorubas have a saying that a child who fails to listen to corrections at home will be corrected outside.</p><p>“Tinubu thinks he is wiser than everyone but the breeze has blown and exposed the behind of the hen. In Yorubaland, a single person cannot be all-in-all. Tinubu thinks he can grab everything with his teeth but they have removed all his teeth.”</p><p>Reacting again to Tinubu’s claim of focusing on helping Nigerians to overcome challenges caused by the current pandemic, Chief George said, “That is his decision. I can’t decide for him. He just issued a statement saying he has not told anyone that he wants to become President in 2023 and his focus now is how to alleviate the sufferings of the people. But you can see what he is doing in Lagos. What about Alpha Beta? Who is still collecting the money for Alpha Beta?”</p><p>“Yet he said he wants to alleviate the sufferings of the people? Let him bring out all our money in Alpha Beta since year 2000 till date. The managing director of Alpha Beta who ran away said they owed him N40b. That money alone would have taken care of millions of poor people in Lagos today. Enough of this brigandage and classic example of greed.”</p><p>“I have always said Tinubu will vomit everything he has stolen and the day of reckoning is here. Only Almighty God can reign yesterday, today and forever. No one else can attain that height. For me, when you start seeing the signal, if he is a very clever person, he will recall himself and have a deep introspection. If he thinks he can run Nigeria the way he did to Lagos, he is making a mistake.”</p><p>Speaking on Tinubu’s impact on Lagos State, how he allegedly turned the state affairs to family business, George noted, “The local government secretariat of Ikoyi/ Obalende was formerly on Glover Road in Ikoyi but he converted the place to his own and moved the local government to Obalende beside the cemetery. He made the daughter the Iyaloja of Lagos.”</p><p>“How can Iyaloja of Lagos be from Iragbiji? She, on her part, went and locked up Computer Village, insisting that she must be paid a certain amount of money. The son is the one getting all public advertisement contracts for Lagos at the moment.”</p><p>“You need to see the son’s convoy, you will think it’s the President that is moving. For how long will this continue? We came into this world naked and we will leave naked. Nobody will leave with anything no matter how much wealth you have amassed for yourself while in existence,”&nbsp;Chief George reiterated.</p><p>Meanwhile, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Independent National Electoral Commission,</strong></a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>INEC has warned political parties in Edo and Ondo State against lateness in the submission of names of the governorship candidate,</strong></a> as nomination closes today (Monday).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH13e5FyZpqok2K2tHnAZpqoppensqit06Kmp2Wfm3q0wNGapaCdXZeypbLEpaOor6Nir7CwxGaenqeinLJuv8uapKxlpJ67tq7UZpipm18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fapc-is-a-congregation-of-strange-bedfellows-bode-george-slams-tinubu-apc.html&text=Tinubu%20Will%20Vomit%20Everything%20He%20Has%20Stolen&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fapc-is-a-congregation-of-strange-bedfellows-bode-george-slams-tinubu-apc.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fapc-is-a-congregation-of-strange-bedfellows-bode-george-slams-tinubu-apc.html&title=Tinubu%20Will%20Vomit%20Everything%20He%20Has%20Stolen" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fapc-is-a-congregation-of-strange-bedfellows-bode-george-slams-tinubu-apc.html&title=Tinubu%20Will%20Vomit%20Everything%20He%20Has%20Stolen" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fapc-is-a-congregation-of-strange-bedfellows-bode-george-slams-tinubu-apc.html&title=Tinubu%20Will%20Vomit%20Everything%20He%20Has%20Stolen" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fapc-is-a-congregation-of-strange-bedfellows-bode-george-slams-tinubu-apc.html&description=Tinubu%20Will%20Vomit%20Everything%20He%20Has%20Stolen" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./35-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="35 Year Old Celebrities | Famous Birthdays">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gordon-lightfoot-13-reasons-why.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Singer Plays a Big Part in Finale">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
