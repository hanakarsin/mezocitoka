In fact, they've maybe overdone the offerings and now people are wondering, what happened to HBO Go? &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">HBO has a whole lot of apps and services, but what happened to HBO Go?</h2><p>In an effort to bring more flexibility to its subscribers and to compete with others like Netflix, HBO has upped their on-demand game. HBO released HBO Go and HBO Now, both different apps that gave their customers different options.</p><p>HBO Go was free to customers who subscribed to their cable's HBO package. It only worked if a customer was paying for cable, and then also for the premium upgrade to receive HBO.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>HBO needs to get their shit together.

It was an amazing offering ‚Äì until the company launched another app called HBO Max.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This whole confusion with HBO Go, HBO Max and HBO Now, reminds me of: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/qhDS5AdjPn</a></p>‚Äî Cynthia ‚ìãüêæ (@_cynthaquil) <a href=#>June 12, 2020</a></figure><p><strong>HBO Max</strong> is available at the same price as HBO Now, but it gives customers access to premium shows that were only available on that platform. HBO Now only contained HBO programs. HBO Max has new shows and movies that were created by Warner Bros and HBO, as well as access to shows on Warner Bros other properties, including the Cartoon Network, CNN, DC Comics, TNT, and TBS.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The three different HBO packages were confusing.</h2><p>Customers like choice and the more the merrier, for the most part. But it was hard to ignore the confusing differences between the three different options HBO was offering alone. It felt very much like every time a family settled on one avenue, the company decided to drop another tier with more options and more confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>People noticed and if you were confused, you were not the only one. And of course, the jokes started. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It‚Äôs really not that hard guys, HBO Go and HBO Now WERE HBOMax but now they‚Äôll become simply: HBO.
