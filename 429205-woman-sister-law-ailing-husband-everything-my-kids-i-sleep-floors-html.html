I had to walk every day from Kangemi to Kawangware because I did not have the money to pay for the whole trip. So I thought shortening the distance would allow me to pay a lesser amount.</p><p class=align-left>I always found him in a bad state. He would have soiled himself, and I would clean that up. I would also use a syringe to feed him milk.</p><p class=align-left>Soon he regained consciousness and was ready to be discharged. The bill was KSh 114,000, and I spoke to the social workers at the hospital to help me with the bill, and it worked.</p><p class=align-left>I was so grateful that finally, I would go home with my husband.

I was heartbroken though I kept holding on, hoping he would be alright soon and we could continue raising our children together.</p><h2>Sister-in-law from hell</h2><p class=align-left>But the sister kept coming and saying nasty things to me.
