Evangelical pastor Paul Mackenzie joined forces with a woman named Ruth Kahindi to create their own church. But Kahindi had no idea what that would lead to. Now, 20 years later, over 300 dead bodies have been exhumed, and more than 600 people are still reported missing, all because of Mackenzie’s “church," which seems much more <a href=#>like a cult</a>.</p><p>As families worry about the whereabouts of their loved ones and other families mourn their losses, we can’t help but wonder where Mackenzie is now. Is he being punished for his crimes, or is he on the run?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@AfricaFactsZone</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Now, Paul Mackenzie is in police custody in Kenya.</h2><p>Despite the over 300 bodies found, the Kenyan doomsday cult leader, Paul Mackenzie, maintains his innocence. The red flags began a few years into the creation of Mackenzie and Kahindi’s Good News International Church. Kahindi told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Nation</a>, “He started preaching things that we did not agree with, telling the congregants not to take their children to school or to go to the hospital when they were sick. I tried to talk him out of it, but unfortunately, I did not succeed.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@criminologyandcoffee href=#>@criminologyandcoffee</a><p>I really can’t believe this isn’t being talked about more…<a title=shakaholacult href=#>#shakaholacult</a> <a title=shakaholaforest href=#>#shakaholaforest</a> <a title=paulmackenzie href=#>#paulmackenzie</a> <a title=kenya href=#>#kenya</a> <a title=doomsday href=#>#doomsday</a> <a title=religiouscult href=#>#religiouscult</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Rebekah T." href=#>♬ original sound - Rebekah T.</a></figure><p>While this happened, Mackenzie’s wife passed away, and he went into his total modern-day persona. He encouraged his followers to quit their jobs, pull their kids out of school, and starve themselves and their children to prepare for the world's end. He said they would get into heaven quicker by starving themselves because heaven will fill up, and the gates will close. It may sound like a stretch to us but many of these people have been following and trusting Mackenzie for decades.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Saved from dying in Shakahola Forest, fake pastor Paul Mackenzie 16 followers are on the verge of death over hunger strike in remand cells - prompt prosecutors to ask High Court for directions.

Mackenzie was taken into police custody, but when he claimed he was no longer a pastor and shirked any responsibility for their deaths, he was released on $109 bail. Yes, only $109!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Paul Mackenzie led a Kenya doomsday cult to a fate of mass murder-suicide, not dissimilar to Jonestown.</h2><p>To this day, the Jonestown mass suicide is still the largest known mass murder-suicide in history. It took place in 1978 in <a href=#>Jonestown, Guyana</a> when <a href=#>Jim Jones</a> essentially forced his followers to take their own lives (and, in some cases, the lives of others) in the event that would result in 918 deaths. But now, the Kenya doomsday cult could give Jonestown a run for its money.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@criminologyandcoffee href=#>@criminologyandcoffee</a><p>Replying to @Rebekah T.

Thankfully, after more suspicious family members came forward, another police raid found much more than they expected. Mackenzie turned himself in to the police on April 14.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Paul Mackenzie's associates collapse at Shanzu Law Court due to fasting <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OofSiAYgKT</a></p>— Kenyans.co.ke (@Kenyans) <a href=#>June 14, 2023</a></figure><p>Even still, Mackenzie maintains his innocence. He hasn’t yet been forced to plead, but when he does, we wouldn’t be surprised if he pleaded not guilty. And despite what he preaches, Mackenzie has no problem eating. His lawyer George Kariuki told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, “He eats and drinks. He is healthy. I have met him personally. There have been rumors that he has refused to eat, and that is not true.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@AfricanaVoice</a></figure><p>If his followers ever questioned why he ate, he would tell them that he needed the energy to spread the gospel and that he would follow them into heaven last. But it seems his widespread indoctrination will have consequences. He’s now being held without bail and could face murder and terrorism charges.</p><p>Some might wonder why he would convince people to starve themselves, and one theory is that it was for organ harvesting. Most exhumed bodies have been found without organs, and there is a high demand for organs on the black market. The other alternative is that Mackenzie really believes what he preaches, although his lack of starvation makes that unlikely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa62uIymmJyjlaPHqrGMp6aw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpaul-mackenzie-now.html&text=Where%20Is%20Kenyan%20Doomsday%20Cult%20Leader%20Paul%20Mackenzie%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpaul-mackenzie-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpaul-mackenzie-now.html&title=Where%20Is%20Kenyan%20Doomsday%20Cult%20Leader%20Paul%20Mackenzie%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpaul-mackenzie-now.html&title=Where%20Is%20Kenyan%20Doomsday%20Cult%20Leader%20Paul%20Mackenzie%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpaul-mackenzie-now.html&title=Where%20Is%20Kenyan%20Doomsday%20Cult%20Leader%20Paul%20Mackenzie%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpaul-mackenzie-now.html&description=Where%20Is%20Kenyan%20Doomsday%20Cult%20Leader%20Paul%20Mackenzie%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-frankie-paul-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Taylor Frankie Paul's Kids?
