But no one is talking enough about Joe's little brother. Or, at least, the kid who might be Joe's half-brother.</p><p>In one of the season's more important flashbacks to Joe's childhood, he ventures out of the boys' home he was sent to and finds his mother.</p><p>Joe sees his mother exiting what appears to be her home. And what's this? She has a toddler in tow, who sort of resembles Joe as a kid. Joe asks his mother why she doesn't love him and why she cares more about the little boy.</p><p>It's a heartbreaking moment and obviously, one that helped shape the man Joe eventually becomes. But what's up with the kid?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Joe have a little brother in 'You'?</h2><p>Although the identity of the little boy isn't totally clear, some <a href=#>You fans</a> believe he's supposed to be Joe's half-brother. After Joe killed his abusive father to protect his mother, he was sent to a home for troubled boys.</p><p>During his time away, there's a chance his mom had another child. And if that's the case, then the little boy he sees with his mother on the street could very well be Joe's secret half-brother.</p><p>What's confusing, however, is why Joe never brings this up in any present-day scenes. The flashback makes it seem like Joe knows his mom had another child. If the little boy was just someone his mom took care of as a nanny or occasional sitter, Joe's comment about her loving the little boy more than him wouldn't have been necessary.</p><p>So right now, it's safe to assume that Joe does have a little brother, and his existence could be addressed in Season 4.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#younetflix</a> SPOILERS</p><p>is there a chance that theo is joe’s brother or is that just me.</p>— Joy ⊗ SAW SHANG-CHI x2 (@GimmeLoki) <a href=#>October 16, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'You' fans have ideas about whom Joe's little brother might be.</h2><p>After that flashback in You Season 3, fans flew to the internet to discuss who Joe's little brother is (provided, of course, that the little boy is indeed Joe's half-brother). If he is, in the present, Joe's little brother should be about eight years younger than him.</p><p>Some fans have tweeted the theory that <a href=#>Theo</a>, the college student boy next door who has an affair with Love, is Joe's little brother.</p><p>And the timing does sort of match up. In You <a href=#>Season 3</a>, Theo is 19 years old. According to Netflix's series description, Joe is supposed to be around 27 years old, give or take a few years. But given Theo's reunion with his step-dad at the end of Season 3 and Joe's relocation to Paris, they might not ever cross paths again.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Season 4: Joe's half brother comes looking for him as their mothers dying wish. <a href=#>#YouNetflix</a> <a href=#>#YOUSEASON3</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rQ2IE6xJQp</a></p>— did you Boca my child (@cheyy_GetLikeMe) <a href=#>October 20, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will there be a Season 4 of 'You'?</h2><p>Fans of Joe Goldberg's creepy stares and impassioned voiceovers can rejoice.
