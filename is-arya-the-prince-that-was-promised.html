With the action spanning a full 80 minutes at Winterfell, fans watched as our beloved characters <a href=#>fought for their lives against the Night King </a>and his army of White Walkers. &nbsp;</p><p>Many of our main characters were struggling to survive as the army of the dead was relentless, and as the slaughter continued — and all hope was seemingly lost — <a href=#>Arya Stark</a> comes in and saves the day. Yes, she stabbed the Night King; therefore, killing him meant all of his followers fell. So, with the Arya being the big hero in the story, many are wondering if she is the prince that was promised?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Arya the Prince that was promised aka Azor Ahai?&nbsp;</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>Throughout the Season 8 episode, fans watched as Arya took down a slew of White Walkers, and showcased her impressive fighting skills. However, as the army of the dead never tires, the young Stark girl stumbles and runs, trying to escape with her life. Arya meets up with the Hound and watches as Beric Dondarrion saves her from Wights, dying in the process. The two are trapped with all hope seemingly lost, but then, <a href=#>Melisandre enters.</a> She reminds Arya of when the two first met in Season 3 and how she prophesied that Arya would “[kill] Brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes sealed shut forever.”&nbsp;</p><p>Recognition sparks in Arya’s eyes, which prompts the Red Woman to remind her what we say to the god of Death. “Not today,” the young wolf remarks before taking off into the halls of Winterfell. The next time fans see Arya is when she stabbed the Night King with her Valyrian steel dagger. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is the Azor Ahai prophecy?</h2><p>Throughout the GOT series, fans have learned the prophecy of Azor Ahai, which states an individual warrior will "lead the people against darkness." While many thought Jon Snow or Daenerys Targaryen would become the "prince (or princess) who was promised," it appears the prophecy was fulfilled by Arya. At the end of the episode, Melisandre feels her work in this world is completed as she takes off her necklace, which prompts her to age rapidly until she dies in the snow. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>While it appears Arya may be the chosen one, some parts of the prophecy did not add up. The young Stark girl was not born near smoke or salt, or under a bleeding star. She also did not sacrifice any loved ones to bring about Azor’s flaming sword, Lightbringer. Some fans were not as convinced that Arya was a reincarnation of Azor Ahai. &nbsp;</p><p>"Arya is not Azor Ahai, and therefore the Night King will rise again. Only after they defeated Cersei will they realize this and end the series with the true Azor Ahai creating Light Bringer. Bran was warging the whole time so we don’t know what he was doing yet. #GamefThrones," one fan tweeted.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Arya is not Azor Ahai, and therefore the Night King will rise again.

"But Azor Ahai is more than that. She/he has to come from Rhaella/Aerys’s bloodline, has to be born in salt and smoke and the bleeding star is a vital point. Arya doesn’t have any of these characteristics.” While it is still unclear if Arya fulfilled the prophecy of the prince that was promised, we love her storyline of being the individual to kill the Night King and save Westeros. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>But Azor Ahai is more than that.
