Twomad's death hasn't stopped his harshest critics from calling out his past behavior.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jhDJkI eZknfg">Callie (Carlos) Cadorniga</a><p class="sc-ensa-Dq fPmIpI">Feb. 15 2024, Published 10:37 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/twomad</a></figure><p>These days, "popular streamer" and "controversy" tend to go hand in hand. No matter what games you're playing or how popular your content becomes, there's almost always a catch to it as these content creators are accused of or exposed for behavior considered to be controversial, problematic, or even criminal. It's enough to cast doubt on almost any streamer lest they be outed for such activity at a moment's notice. The same can be said for Muudea Sedik aka <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twomad</a>, even upon his death.</p><p>The 24-year-old streamer gained popularity on YouTube and <a href=#>Twitch</a> as he played games like <a href=#>Fortnite</a> and <a href=#>Overwatch</a>. He also posted several online skits and commentary videos to the tune of over 2 million subscribers.</p><p>On Feb. 13, 2024, Twomad was found dead in his residence. However, Twomad's sudden passing hasn't stopped his harshest critics from calling out his past behavior. But why does everyone hate Twomad anyway? Let's break it down.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/twomad</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why does everyone seem to hate Twomad?</h2><p>Twomad was known for his gaming streams and various spin-off channels, but he was equally as infamous for online feuds and allegations lobbied against him. Back in 2019, he posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">parody video</a> in which he mocked K-pop fans and popular K-pop bands like <a href=#>BTS</a> using racist rhetoric and commentary. The video was met with immense backlash from K-pop fans, who proceeded to flood Twomad's social media with hateful messages in turn. He even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> to have received a lawsuit from BTS for the video.</p><p>Naturally, Twomad's controversies don't end there. Online, he once asked his younger fans to send him their Zoom passwords for online classes so that he could <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">crash in</a> on the sessions during the initial COVID-19 pandemic. Later in 2022, he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested</a> during a Six Flags visit for trespassing and unruly behavior at the park.</p><p>Things get even worse in 2023. On June 23, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> about allegedly having a girlfriend. However, the picture he tried to use as proof was a picture of a 16-year-old trans girl named Brianna Ghey who had been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">murdered</a> in a hate crime several months prior.</p><p>Shortly after that on June 24, Twitter user GlocksGoldi <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> screenshots of a Discord conversation between herself and Twomad, accusing the YouTuber of sexual assault. Although Twomad denied these claims at the time, more screenshots were revealed.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>how it feels logging on to see twomad died <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Xgnnjec4ps</a></p>â€” xlanicy (@crazydog1435) <a href=#>February 14, 2024</a></figure><p>These major events earned Twomad plenty of haters throughout his career, which may just explain the divisive reaction that the internet gave upon learning of his death. On Feb. 13, 2024, Twomad was found unresponsive in his home after LAPD authorities went in for a welfare check. He hadn't been heard from for several days leading up to the discovery. Several drugs were also found on the scene, suggesting that he may have died from an overdose.</p><p>Although his body was found on Feb. 13, evidence suggests that he may have died several days prior. Twomad's online Discord status states that he was logged into Overwatch for several days. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, his status still appears as playing the game.</p><p>Even after Twomad's death, the internet is divided between respecting those affected by the deceased and remembering his controversial online and IRL behavior.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxllauys8XOp5xmoJGpsm7A1qikmpw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-does-everyone-hate-twomad.html&text=Why%20Does%20Everyone%20Hate%20Twomad%3f%20Details%20on%20Late%20Streamer&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-does-everyone-hate-twomad.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-does-everyone-hate-twomad.html&title=Why%20Does%20Everyone%20Hate%20Twomad%3f%20Details%20on%20Late%20Streamer" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-does-everyone-hate-twomad.html&title=Why%20Does%20Everyone%20Hate%20Twomad%3f%20Details%20on%20Late%20Streamer" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-does-everyone-hate-twomad.html&title=Why%20Does%20Everyone%20Hate%20Twomad%3f%20Details%20on%20Late%20Streamer" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-does-everyone-hate-twomad.html&description=Why%20Does%20Everyone%20Hate%20Twomad%3f%20Details%20on%20Late%20Streamer" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./june29-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="June 29 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nigerian-pastor-jailed-for-stealing.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nigerian Pastor Jailed For Stealing">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
