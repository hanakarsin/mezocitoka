If they come down to the office, if the students in the cafeteria, no problem."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @daddy.wendy.chill</span></figure><p>Cappello added that a member of the school's administrative team would then get the student to meet with the driver and that the deliveries should be scheduled to lunch time hours.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @daddy.wendy.chill</span></figure><p>It seems that students are relying on delivery services to get the grub they crave delivered to schools, with more and more teens using them throughout the country, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but not all districts are on board</a>. It appears that the biggest criticism of the apps is that they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pose potential security risks</a> as non-students are being called, sometimes at times when administrators aren't on hand to meet with them, and are interacting with students.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @daddy.wendy.chill</span></figure><p>What do you think? Should students be allowed to order DoorDash while they're in school as long as they follow the building's security guidelines? Or do you think it's distracting and they should either pack their own lunch or eat whatever fare is offered at the school?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMG2sMSnq6xllKS8s7DArJ9mnp%2BksW7AzmaqnKCfpLk%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fstudents-doordash-food-to-school.html&text=High%20School%20Students%20DoorDash%20Lunch%20to%20School%2c%20Get%20Sent%20to%20Admins%20Office%20in%20Viral%20TikTok&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstudents-doordash-food-to-school.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstudents-doordash-food-to-school.html&title=High%20School%20Students%20DoorDash%20Lunch%20to%20School%2c%20Get%20Sent%20to%20Admins%20Office%20in%20Viral%20TikTok" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fstudents-doordash-food-to-school.html&title=High%20School%20Students%20DoorDash%20Lunch%20to%20School%2c%20Get%20Sent%20to%20Admins%20Office%20in%20Viral%20TikTok" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fstudents-doordash-food-to-school.html&title=High%20School%20Students%20DoorDash%20Lunch%20to%20School%2c%20Get%20Sent%20to%20Admins%20Office%20in%20Viral%20TikTok" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstudents-doordash-food-to-school.html&description=High%20School%20Students%20DoorDash%20Lunch%20to%20School%2c%20Get%20Sent%20to%20Admins%20Office%20in%20Viral%20TikTok" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./324853-mbona-mwataka-kunizika-nikiwa-hai-uhuru-awauliza-viongozi-wa-mlima-kenya-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mbona mwataka kunizika nikiwa hai? - Uhuru awauliza viongozi wa Mlima Kenya">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./anna.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anna Quintana - Distractify">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
